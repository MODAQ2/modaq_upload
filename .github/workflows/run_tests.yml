  # Runs when commits are pushed directly to these branches
  # Note: we are purposly skipping push in favor of branch protection rules
  # that require PRs to be opened against these branches. This ensures that all
  # changes are reviewed and pass tests before being merged. This avoids
  # running tests on every push to feature branches, which can be noisy and
  # inefficient. Instead, tests will only run when a PR is opened or updated
  # that targets the main or develop branches.

  #   branches: [main, develop]
